Cases


	Claude vs Sheryl

Sheryl bought the car from Marty. There was no evidence of prior knowledge of Claude’s offer or of her knowing Claude.

	Rules/Principles applied

Claude did not communicate the offer to Sheryl. The rules of offer stipulate:

	the offer must be communicated to the offeree
	the offeree must have knowlede of the offer for it to be valid and enforceable
	Claude vs Marty

On June 5, Marty responded to the advertisement from Claude. While pretending to be Mr. Markland, “he gave Claude a cheque for $2.6m and drove away the car.” The cheque was dishonoured; Claude also discovered that Marty was not Mr. Markland. Claude had not asked for identification. Marty sold the car to Sheryl and “absconded with the money”.

Rules/Principles applied

This was not a contract. It was an Invitation to Treat.

	Claude vs Jen

Jen received the letter on June 1. He immediately phoned Claude, but got his answering machine. Jen left a message “stating that he would pay $2.5 for the vehicle”. Jen then waited for a response from Claude, but, “not wanting to lose the car, left another message saying he would pay $3m. Claude retrieved both messages on June 3.”

	Claude vs Sonia

On June 1, Claude received a letter stating her interest in buying the car, that “she wanted an expert to give his opinion on the vehicle,” and with a cheque for $1m, showing her commitment in buying the car. In the letter, she also requested that Claude not show the car to anyone until June 8. On receiving the cheque, Claude immediately lodged it in his bank account.

	Claude vs Harris

Harris saw Claude’s letter on June 7. Claude called Harris 5 minutes later and personally withdrew his offer to sell him the car. “Harris still proceeded to post his letter of acceptance on June 8 to Claude.”

	Claude vs Mardi Gras Hotel

Claude checked in and registered at the Mardi Gras Hotel. He went to his room where he saw a very large notice over the bed, stating “The hotel is not liable for any losses and/or damage suffered by any guests while on the property.” 

“He left his gold watch and bracelet in the room and went to dinner. He gave the key to the receptionist for safekeeping”. Upon his return to his room, “he discovered that the jewellery and other important documents were missing.” The hotel denies liability for the loss of his items.
