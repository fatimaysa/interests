\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\s27\sl480\slmult1\itap0{\s27\f1\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch First, the people who were present were ones with whom I always socialize and this included my cousin. They were certainly interested in my well being. These individuals foresaw trouble. They stuck by me throughout my ordeal.

Undoubtedly, I was confident, that having these persons around I would have received great assistance that would enable me to escape this ordeal.}{\s27\f1\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\par}

\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\s27\sl480\slmult1\itap0{\s27\f1\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch I was not left alone.

\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\s27\sl480\slmult1\itap0{\s27\f1\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch The second factor, motive, speaks to something that causes a person to act in a certain way; an impulse that acts as an incitement to action. When I examine the instances that relate to motives I am of the opinion that it refers to my motive and that of my peers. On that occasion, my cousin saw my ordeal, which created an impulse to which he reacted. Without any hesitation, he immediately came to my rescue. He took responsibility for my survival. On the other hand, I displayed a humble attitude towards my cousin. I showed appreciation for the assistance he gave me. My sole intention was to get out of the water even though it seemed difficult. I was incited to action. As a result I cooperated with my cousin and in a moment I was out of the water. Additionally, I went on to do my laundry and head home.}{\s27\f1\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\par}

It is said that interest is a state of curiosity or concern about or attention given to something or some one.  It also refers to the feeling of a person whose attention, concern or curiosity is particularly engaged by something. I believe the right motives that the individuals displayed towards me in my ordeal were fuelled by the interest they had in me. For me, my only interest at the time was to get out of the dead zone.}{\s27\f1\fs24\lang1033{\*\listtag0}\par}
